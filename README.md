### Dispatching Missions

Missions are how you give your agent a task — structured prompts with built-in progress tracking.

**Six built-in templates:**

| Template | Use when you need to... |
|----------|------------------------|
| Build Feature | Plan and implement a new feature end-to-end |
| Content Creation | Write documentation, posts, or other content |
| Research & Analyse | Deep research with structured findings and citations |
| Code Review | Review code for bugs, security issues, and improvements |
| Debug & Fix | Reproduce, diagnose, and fix a reported issue |
| DevOps Maintenance | Maintain and improve infrastructure |

You can also create your own templates and save them for reuse.

**Each mission has two parts:**
- **Instruction** — The agent's role and numbered steps (pre-filled by templates)
- **Context** — Specific details for this run (you fill this in)

**Three dispatch modes:**

| Mode | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| Save Draft | Stores the mission without running it |
| Run Now | Creates a one-shot cron job, executes within ~60 seconds |
| Repeating | Creates a scheduled cron job on a repeating interval |

When you dispatch, the mission appears under "Active Missions" with a status badge:

| Status | Colour | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Queued** | Orange | Cron job created, waiting for scheduler |
| **Dispatched** | Blue | Agent is working |
| **Successful** | Green | Completed successfully |
| **Failed** | Red | Error or cancelled |

Status updates automatically as the agent progresses. No manual refresh needed.

**Re-dispatching:** Completed or failed missions can be re-dispatched. Expand the mission detail panel and click "Edit & Re-Dispatch". A new mission is created with the same prompt — the original is preserved.

---

### Cron Jobs

Cron jobs are scheduled tasks that run automatically. Missions create cron jobs under the hood, but you can also manage them directly.

**What you can do:**
- View all jobs with schedule, last run, and next run
- Pause and resume jobs
- Trigger a manual run
- Edit prompts and schedules
- Delete jobs

**Schedule formats:**

```
every 5m          every 15m          every 1h          every 24h
0 */2 * * *       daily at 9am       0 9 * * 1-5       @weekly
```

Job results are delivered to your configured Discord channel (`DISCORD_HOME_CHANNEL` in `.env`).

---

### Agent Behaviour

Navigate to `Agent -> Behaviour` to edit the files that shape how your agent thinks and acts:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| SOUL.md | Personality, tone, communication style |
| HERMES.md | Priority project instructions (highest priority context) |
| USER.md | Your preferences, priorities, personal details |
| MEMORY.md | The agent's curated memories |
| AGENT.md | Agent instructions and behaviour guidelines |
| .env | Environment variables (keys masked as `sk-...abcd`) |
| AGENTS.md | Project conventions (auto-scanned from directories) |

Changes take effect on the agent's next session. No restart required.

---

### Configuration

Navigate to `Config Settings -> All Settings` for full control over 27 sections:

**Core** — Agent behaviour, model selection, display settings, memory provider

**Infrastructure** — Terminal backends, compression, browser, checkpoints

**Security** — Safety rules, privacy, approval modes

**Voice & Audio** — TTS, STT, voice settings

**Automation** — Delegation, cron defaults, session reset

**Integrations** — Platform-specific settings

Every section shows which fields are configured and which use defaults. Changes save to `~/.hermes/config.yaml` with automatic backup.

---

### Sessions

Browse every conversation your agent has had across all platforms (Discord, Telegram, CLI, etc.).

- Sort by most recent
- See session source and file size
- Click to expand the full transcript with colour-coded messages
- Filter by role (User, Assistant, Tool)
- Collapsible tool outputs with summaries

---

### Memory

If you have Holographic Memory installed, the Memory page lets you browse, search, add, edit, and delete memory facts.

```bash
hermes plugins install hermes-memory-store
```

Facts are extracted automatically during conversations (when `auto_extract` is enabled) or added manually. Each fact has a category, tags, and trust score.

> **Note:** If Holographic Memory is not installed, the page shows a helpful notice with install instructions instead of crashing.

---

### Gateway

The Gateway page shows which messaging platforms are connected:

| Platform | Status indicators |
|----------|------------------|
| Discord | Connected / Not configured |
| Telegram | Connected / Not configured |
| Slack | Connected / Not configured |
| WhatsApp | Connected / Not configured |

Connected platforms show a green indicator with pulse animation.

---

### Skills & Tools

- **Skills** (`Agent -> Skills`) — Browse all installed skills with their documentation. Skills are on-demand knowledge documents the agent loads when needed.
- **Tools** (`Agent -> Tools`) — Toggle which toolsets are available per platform. Disable browser access on Discord but keep it on CLI? This is where you do it.

---

### Rec Room

The Rec Room is a creative playground where you describe what you want to create and your agent brings it to life.

**Three activities:**

| Activity | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Creative Canvas** | Generate interactive p5.js animations from any description — literal ("solar system") to abstract ("what does pain look like?") |
| **ASCII Studio** | Create ASCII art from prompts, convert images, generate text banners with 571 fonts, and animate your creations |
| **Story Weaver** | Build interactive fiction collaboratively — configure your world, navigate page-by-page, steer the narrative |

**How it works:**
1. Pick an activity from the Rec Room hub or sidebar
2. Type what you want to create
3. Click "Enhance & Create" — your agent interprets and generates
4. Refine, save, and export your creations

All activities use your configured LLM provider — no extra setup needed.

### Tips

> **Auto-refresh** — Dashboard and cron pages auto-refresh every 15 seconds. No need to manually reload.

> **Toast notifications** — All actions produce confirmation toasts. They stay visible for 4 seconds.

> **Destructive actions** — Deleting missions, cron jobs, or memories always requires confirmation.

> **Network access** — Use `npm run start:network` to access the dashboard from other devices on your LAN.

> **Memory optional** — The dashboard works fully without Holographic Memory. You will see "Not Installed" instead of crashing.

## Managing Mission Control

### Install

Fresh install or reinstall:

```bash
# Standalone installer (auto-clones):
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daniel-Parke/hermes-mission-control/main/scripts/install.sh)

# Or from a clone:
cd mission-control
bash scripts/install.sh
```

The installer checks prerequisites (Node.js 18+, Hermes agent), detects existing installations, and prompts before overwriting.

### Update

Pull the latest version from the main branch:

**From the sidebar:** Click "Check" to check for updates. If available, click "Update Now" (orange button). The app will pull, build, and restart automatically.

**From the terminal:**

```bash
cd ~/mission-control
bash scripts/update.sh
```

The update script fetches from `origin/main`, runs `npm install` if dependencies changed, builds, and restarts. If the build fails, the update aborts without restarting — the server keeps running the current version.

### Restart

Restart the web server without changing the code:

**From the sidebar:** Click the "Restart" button.

**From the terminal:**

```bash
cd ~/mission-control
bash scripts/restart.sh
```

### Troubleshooting

**Server won't start (port 3000 in use):**

```bash
fuser -k 3000/tcp
npm run start:network
```

**Build fails after update:**

The update script aborts on build failure without restarting. Check the error:

```bash
cat ~/.hermes/logs/mc-update.log
```

Fix the issue, then rebuild:

```bash
cd ~/mission-control
npm run build
bash scripts/restart.sh
```

**Gateway not running (no cron jobs executing):**

```bash
systemctl --user status hermes-gateway
systemctl --user start hermes-gateway
```

**Reset to clean state:**

```bash
cd ~/mission-control
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main
npm install
npm run build
bash scripts/restart.sh
```

**View deploy/update logs:**

```bash
cat ~/.hermes/logs/mc-update.log
cat ~/.hermes/logs/mc-restart.log
```

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS |
| Data | Direct file I/O on `~/.hermes/` + SQLite for memory |
| API | RESTful routes under `/api/` |
| State | React hooks (no external state management) |
| YAML | js-yaml for all config parsing |

All API routes import paths from `src/lib/hermes.ts` for consistency. The app reads from `~/.hermes/` but never writes to `config.yaml` directly.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev           # Start dev server with hot reload
npm run build         # Production build
npm run test          # Run test suite
npm run start         # Production server (localhost only)
npm run start:network # Production server (accessible on LAN)
```

**Data storage:** Missions and custom templates are stored at `~/.hermes/mission-control/data/`. This keeps your data portable — it travels with your Hermes config, not the app directory.

**Environment variables** (optional, in `.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HERMES_HOME` | `~/.hermes` | Path to Hermes home directory |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port |
